# OHIO International Hospital Management System
Developed by **Hamza Raheem**

CMS ID: **512131**


## Steps to run the project:
- Extract the zip folder in your local computer
- Open the root folder [Hospital Management System]() in IntelliJ Idea
- Go to the Main class inside the [src](src) folder. 
- Run the project.

**NOTE:** I didn't make the whole system to allow every input from the user. I believe that it will be the best idea to put it aside for now and learn a UI Java Library first and then implement on the User experience. I hope I have met the requirements for the assignments. If there are suggestions, please add them on the LMS feedback. I'll sure I implement on them in the next phase of this project. Thank you.
